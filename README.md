# 🗡️ Kensei DSA - Master All Patterns

**Solve DSA like Puzzles through Structured Patterns, not Random Problems**

---

## 🎯 What is Kensei DSA?

Kensei DSA is a **curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms patterns** across **all topics** - not just Dynamic Programming, but Arrays, Trees, Graphs, Strings, and everything in between. 

### The Problem We Solve

Most developers:
- ❌ Solve hundreds of random problems without clear progression
- ❌ Jump between topics without mastering fundamentals
- ❌ Struggle to identify patterns in new problems
- ❌ End up with scattered knowledge instead of systematic understanding

### Our Approach

- ✅ **Pattern-First Learning**: Master patterns, then apply them to multiple problems
- ✅ **Structured Divisions**: Each topic has multiple patterns, each pattern has multiple sections
- ✅ **Puzzle Mindset**: Think of DSA as solving puzzles, not just writing code
- ✅ **Systematic Coverage**: Ensure you cover all fundamentals before moving forward
- ✅ **Deep Understanding**: Multiple sections per pattern for thorough comprehension

## 🌸 Philosophy - The Way of Kensei (剣聖)

> "Just as a Kensei (Sword Saint) dedicates their life to the mastery of the blade through disciplined practice, we believe every developer can achieve DSA mastery through persistent, structured learning."

Inspired by Japanese discipline and aesthetics, Kensei DSA transforms the overwhelming world of DSA into a clear, navigable path to mastery.
